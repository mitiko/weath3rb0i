# weath3rb0i - lightweight CM text compressor

weath3rb0i is a CM single-file text compressor aimed at delivering high compression ratios
with novel modeling approaches.

The goal for v1.0:
- 12-bit state table
- written in 100% safe rust
- output stats from contexts for use by external neural nets
- APM mixers

Wishing to futher experiment with:
- entropy based hashing
- CM parsing optimization
- MT
